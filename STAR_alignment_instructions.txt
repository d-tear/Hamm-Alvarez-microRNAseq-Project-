###miRNA-seq read alignment using STAR aligner###

#First I generated the annotated mouse genome index. The relavant FATSA and GTF files are below. They were taken from GENCODE 
Release M19 (GRCm38.p6):

1) FASTA

Genome sequence, primary assembly (GRCm38) 	PRI 	

    Nucleotide sequence of the GRCm38 primary genome assembly (chromosomes and scaffolds)
    The sequence region names are the same as in the GTF/GFF3 files

2) Annotation/GTF

Comprehensive gene annotation 	PRI 	

    It contains the comprehensive gene annotation on the primary assembly (chromosomes and scaffolds) sequence regions
    This is a superset of the main annotation file
